# Higher-Lower-Game-Project
An addictive game of higher or lower using inbuilt data file.
 In this game, we compare some information about two persons or organizations. For example, in this game project, we will be comparing the Instagram followers of the two. If you get it right your score increases otherwise the program ends when you make a wrong guess.
 This project is a copy of classical version on of the game available online (http://www.higherlowergame.com)

# Higher-Lower-Game-Project
An addictive game of higher or lower using an inbuilt data file. In this game, we compare some information about two persons or organizations. For example, in this game project, we will compare the two's Instagram followers. If you get it right your score increases otherwise the program ends when you make a wrong guess. This project is a copy of the classical version of the game available online (http://www.higherlowergame.com)
